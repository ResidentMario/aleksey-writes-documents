This notebook is a summary of the content programs in running from various ML tech companies. I already have a strong idea of what a content program should look like, and how it should be shaped, which comes from my work at Quilt Data and from my conversations with the marketing consultants at Quilt Data. But most programs are far from the ideal vision of 1/week. What do ML startups I'm aware of do in practice? we are working to build out a new community resource to help people learn more about ML and related topics They have an AI Wiki (https://docs.paperspace.com/machine-learning/) which is a just barely veiled product ad...topic coverage is thin, on the order of what I could write in a week of work, and highly CTA'd to the Paperspace domain. There's even a link to contact sales in the header! This is an example of content that I think does you no good. If you're publishing learning materials, you need to answer the question: "what makes me different from FastAI?".
