I've written pieces of notebooks on the various sorting algorithms and their properties in different assorted places over time, it's time to run through them again and consolidate my notes into a single notebook with all of the bits in it. Bubble sort also has $O(n^2)$ worst-case performance due to its use of two loops. The worst case occurs when the first value in the sorted list appears in the last value in the array. Selection sort is similarly $O(n^2)$.
