Replicate the following model, taken from the Fast.AI Part 1 curriculum: The fast.ai model is constructed using the fast.ai library, including fast.ai preprocessing steps. For this exercise I will reverse-engineer this model in PyTorch. The objective is to ultimately get somewhat comparable performance, though my model will not include many of the tricks fast.ai inserts into things to improve their training results. The objective of this project is to acquire more familiarity with writing PyTorch models. The resulting model is CPU-bound.
