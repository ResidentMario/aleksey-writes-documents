This is a specific S3 feature that I'm covering as a product addition. This notebook collects my raw notes on the subject. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) offers S3 Standard-IA performance but with only a single region. 99.5% availability and 11 9s of durability, but since all replication is performed in the same availability zone, the 11 9s come with an asterisk: in the case of a regional disaster resulting in the destruction of data across data centers, your data will be lost. This is referred to as "Availability Zone destruction". In practice, any event significant enough to constitute availability zone destruction is likely to cause your company much bigger problems than data loss. Reference on availability zone destruction: link. So basically you can treat this tier as S3 Standard-IA with weaker uptime guarantees. The loss of the third 9 is due to the potential for datacenter downtime. This makes this tier most appropriate for secondary backups. S3 Glacier is the best-known of the two archival tiers of S3. It offers configurable first-byte retrieval time dependent on how much you're willing to pay for bandwidth, measured in minutes or hours. 99.99% availability and and 11 9s durability. Glacier is good for long term document storage. From the page.
