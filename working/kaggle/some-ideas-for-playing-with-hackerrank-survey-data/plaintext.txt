In this notebook I'm sharing some doodles for playing with the HackerRank Survey dataset. YMMV! Most users finish writing out their survey responses in nine minutes or so. There are some long tails however, probably people that just left the tab open and came back to it later (which is understandable). About 12% of respondants left the tab open for more than 30 minutes. This is the "long tail" in this time-spent graph. I do not understand why Ghana is the most common respondant country. India and United States make a lot of sense, but it feels like there's something funky going on with who the survey was distributed to maybe? With data of this shape it's most useful to look at questions on a case-by-case basis, or otherwise to consider them in small multiples. However, I was curious what we would get if we just "shipped" all of the questions all at once. For example, here are the differences in the mean responses to the questions, on a converted numeric scale, between a bunch of different pairs of countries. In theory we could use this methodology to pick out countries that have similar average responses scores, which might be meaningful. However, a quick inspection of the resulting data revealed that the countries didn't appear in any particularly notable order. In fact, average response seem to be randomly normally distributed: Which is a good signal that there is no signal there. Drat! Oh well. Here's a different approach you can take to questions like education level. There are two salient groups, the education level per respondant (which ought to tell us something about average HackerRank members): And per country (which tells us something about average education levels per country): Looks like for countries with statistically significant response rates, folks with college degrees predominate!
