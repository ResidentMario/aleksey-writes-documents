This code sample appears at the tail end of Raymond Hettinger's talk on concurrent programming. It is a basic asynchronous server implementation that demonstrates the Python socket API alongside an implementation of the asynchronous programming model for a server task. I am not yet at the level of understanding this program, due to not having a strong enough understanding of socket programming. I will return to this another tinme. :)
