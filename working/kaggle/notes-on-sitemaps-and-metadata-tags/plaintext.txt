These are two HTML5 features whose manipulation is useful for social purposes. Sitemaps are XML documents which states what pages are included in a domain used for the purposes of enabling the website's pages to be crawled and indexed by search engines. Sitemaps are not strictly necessary for smaller websites and for websites in which all of the pages are well-linked to one another. They may be more useful for more complex, less discoverable websites. However, at worst, they can't hurt.
