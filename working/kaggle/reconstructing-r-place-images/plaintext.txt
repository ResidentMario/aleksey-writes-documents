This kernel demonstrates how to use this dataset's update history to construct "snapshots" of what r/place looked like at various points in time. It's meant to help you get started with running your own analysis using this dataset. You can copy the code here into your own kernel and reuse it yourself! As you can see above the dataset is not sorted when it comes in. Since we need to capture every change as a time X, we need to sort it ourselves. The cell block below is the data conversion code. We'll walk through it shortly. The first function we use is place_at_timestamp, which generates a record of what the contents of each pixel were at any selected time. Within this dataset 1491238734000 is the maximum possible time and 1490918688000 is the minimum possible time, so let's, for the purposes of this demo, pick a timestamp right in the middle of r/Place history. The other function is construct_image_matrix, which constructs a numpy matrix using the (more interpretable) data we got out of place_at_timestamp. Lastly, with the matrix at hand, we can finally plot r/Place for ourselves! With the code out of the way, building r/Place image at a timestamp of your choice is as simple as: One last thing to keep in mind: with our method, imshow will plot pixels which have not yet received a color in black.
