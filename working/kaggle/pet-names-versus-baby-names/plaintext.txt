 What makes for a good pet name? Sometimes people name their pets with human-sounding names like "Jacob", "Abbie", and "Tyler". However, the most popular pet names in the popular consciousness --- names like "Spot", "Rex", and "Pluto" --- are decidingly not human-sounding. Can we figure out which of these two "kinds" of names is more common in reality? First, we need to import our data and coprocess it to find the overlapping dog/human names. We will combine two datasets: the present dataset of dog names in New York City, and a part of the US Baby Names by State dataset corresponding with recent newborns in New York State. The most popular human also-dog names are hardly distinguishable from simply very popular human names. And here are some very popular pet names which are also occassionally baby names: So: how much overlap is there between baby names and pet names? To answer, let's slightly rephrase this question: assuming an equal number of babies and pets, given a name, how often can correctly guess whether it belongs to a baby or a pet? We can examine the results of our heuristical classification system in a confusion matrix. A confusion matrix pitches the classes that we predict against the classes that are actually correct. Converting this to percentages: 80% of pet names are naively human sounding. We can see this intuitively! Let's draw sample pet names five at a time. Does it seem right to you that just one of these five names sounds doggy to you? "Spot" sounds like an obviously "doggy" name to me, while the rest of them sound quite human. For your consideration, here's ten more lists of names:
