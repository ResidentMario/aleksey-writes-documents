This notebook has some notes on some recent style transfer papers, as of late 2019. Style transfer originated with a 2015 paper. The network in that paper was a convolutional neural network which cleverly performed gradient updates on its input image. I covered that network in detail, including the reference PyTorch implementation, in this prior notebook; and I've evaluated using that network for a project. After fiddling with it for a bit, I'm setting it aside and checking out some other newer network architectures to see if I can get better results with something more modern. That means hitting the papers. A Closed Form Solution to Universial Style Transfer
