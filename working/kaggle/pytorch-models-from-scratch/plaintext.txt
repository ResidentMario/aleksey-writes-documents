This is the first entry in a sequence of notebooks in which I attempt to replicate the models built in the PyTorch documentation guides from scratch. The great thing about these models is that they are simple and well-referenced, so I should be able to make good progress on my understanding of the library in this guided setting. :)  This is a modified version of the previous CNN which demonstrates the PyTorch Dataloader API and modifies the CNN for three-channel input. The next bit is a custom data loader. torch.utils.data.Dataset is an abstract class representing a dataset. Your custom dataset should inherit Dataset and override the following methods: __len__ so that len(dataset) returns the size of the dataset. __getitem__ to support the indexing such that dataset[i] can be used to get ith sample Not going to implement the data transforms, but here's a skeleton:  A GAN model that does faces. We'll just do the generator component because that's the only component that has a diagram:
