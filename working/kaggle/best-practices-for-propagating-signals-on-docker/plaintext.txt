The PID 1 special-casing is basically a design error on Docker's part. Docker now supports running tini, a proper initialization process, in PID 1, by passing the --init flag to docker run. That results in the following process tree (assuming you follow the other advice): tini has a SIGTERM signal handler. It propogates the signal to the process group of its children, then exits itself once they are done exiting. This is the behavior you want!
