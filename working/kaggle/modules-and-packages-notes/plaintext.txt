This notebook constitutes my notes on David Beazley's Modules and Packages talk (which I watched for the second time, this is very dense material!) In Python 2 there was the ability to import a module that was located in the same folder as the current module. E.g.: And in spam.py: This was disallowed in Python 3. Instead you can use an absolute import that references the parent name (which is included in the PYTHONPATH): But this is fragile. There are also explicit relative imports that use the dot operator to mark where the import is coming from. This is recommended.
