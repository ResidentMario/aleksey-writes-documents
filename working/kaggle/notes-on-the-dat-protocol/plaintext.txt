The next discovery method: centralized DNS discovery against known servers. In this case the network traffic (all of it in DNS) goes something like this: Yes, I have two TXT records. One is an anti-IP-spoofing token, which protects against IP spoofing attacks. This is presumably thanks to DNSSEC, but the mechanism by which this works is unknown to me, and is not described in the text. All future requests in both directions include this token. The other is a list of IP addresses and ports of peers to talk to. The client is expected to then connect to those peers. Also, the client sends another DNS TXT record, this time stating it would like to subscribe to the peer list for this piece of data. The server will then send this client any other peers it becomes aware of in the form of a SRV record. Peer listing is on a 60-second timeout.
