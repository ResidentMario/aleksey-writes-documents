The basic format of find is: The arguments configure symlink following behavior and are broadly unimportant. One path is required, many are possible (multidirectory find). Paths are prefixed with switches controlling what attribute is being searched: -name for the filename, -path for the absolute path. You can specify a command to be run on the input filename using -exec. The syntax for the command that follows is really weird: The quoting of the semicolon ; is required to escape it out of shell. This is extremely hand when used in combination with grep and logs: This finds all lines in configuration files with host in them.
