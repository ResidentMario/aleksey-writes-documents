This notebook is my notes on the series "Production-ready Docker images". "Capabilities" in this context are a technical term: Linux capabilities give processes the ability to do some of the many privileged operations only root can do by default. For example, CAP_CHOWN allows a process to "make arbitrary changes to file UIDs and GIDs". If we run docker run with -p 5000:5000, it will forward from all interfaces where the Docker daemon is running (for our purposes, the main network namespace) to the external IP address of the containter. Useful tip: You therefore need to listen on the external IP inside the container, and the easiest way to do that is by listening on all interfaces: 0.0.0.0.
