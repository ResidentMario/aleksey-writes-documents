This notebook is a quick exploration of this dataset that I put together out of sheer fascination. I'm going to take a look at what the most common product links are on some of the subreddits that I personally am most active on. Sorry not sorry; if you're a Redditor and have your own subreddits of interest, try forking this notebook and poking around on your own list! First of all, though, a small note on the format of the dataset. Subreddits are binned by their first letter, then their name. So e.g. "r/tennis" will map to t/tennis in this dataset. And so, without further ado, let's see what we get! This community has an obsession with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Not surprised to see that shows through even in products they buy...these are some good book recommendations! Creatine and cheap headphones, folks. Party Shark is so in fashion. The rest of these are pretty standard men's fashion recommendations: Sieko/Casio starter watches, Levi's 511s, and Clark Desert Boots, which are kind of a meme in this community. Oh, and a book on the art of tidying up. Guess that's going on my reading list. As though you didn't already know. These are some really good book recommendations. The_Donald is the subreddit for Trump supporters on Reddit. The Trump+Reddit intersection is a really weird sliver on the Internet. What about their literature? Uh. Seems about right. I encourage you to fork this notebook and tinker with your own recommendations! Alternatively, you can browse the data in a more leisurely format by checking out https://thingsonreddit.com/
