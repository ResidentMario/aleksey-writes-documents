This section of the notes taken from the Wikipedia article on hashcash. Hashcash is designed to combat email spam. Hashcash adds the following header to the email: The header contains: The following section draws from the Hashcash article on the Bitcoin wiki. We state that the proof of work presented by hashcash is formulaicly: $$H(s,c)//2^{(n-k)}=0$$ Where: For example assume $H=\text{SHA-4}$ (an imaginary 4-digit hash function), so $n=4$. $k=2$. $c=0$. $s=\text{foo}$. Suppose $H(s, c) = 0010$. Then we have: $$H(s, c) // 2^{(4 - 2)} = \text{num}(0010) \: // \: 2^{2} = 2 \: // \: 4 = 0$$
$$\therefore H(s, c)\text{ is valid}$$ Bitcoin targets 10-minute block intervals. This cannot be achieved with the reference implementation, as difficulty can be scaled up only exponentially, by adding extra digits of zero-ness. So Bitcoin modifies the proof of work to: $$H(s,x,c) < 2^(n-k)$$ Where $k$ is no longer constrained to be an integer, but can be fractional. Since the second value is controlled by the network we may alias it to $\text{target} = 2^(n - k)$. This section continued from the previous one, using the same reference article. As the cost to mine a bitcoin increased, mining pools were introduced. A mining pool has miners use the same reward address for every user in the pool. A naive stateless implementation of this system can have miners potentially duplicate work. To avoid this, early implementations of the mining pool protocol had the pool assign each miner a block to mine instead. This meant that miners were not validating their own block (what does this mean? I don't know just yet), which reduced the security of the network as a whole. With the introduction of extra nonce current best practice is to have the pool's miners choose which parts of the blocks to work on, work on them, and submit them to the pool. Sufficiently random iteration prevents work collisions whilst retaining the statelessness of the system. This section taken from the Ethereum wiki article on proof of stake: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ. Many newer cryptocurrencies use a proof of stake system instead of a proof of work one. Quoting the definition in the wiki: Proof of Stake (PoS) is a category of consensus algorithms for public blockchains that depend on a validator's economic stake in the network. a proof of work containing a transaction, the version of the transaction that is included in that block is cleared. It becomes impossible to clear the other version of that transaction. See my notes bitcoin for more deets.
