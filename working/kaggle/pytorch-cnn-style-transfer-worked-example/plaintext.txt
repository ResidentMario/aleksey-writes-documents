This notebook is a run of the model presented in the PyTorch tutorial section Neural Transfer Using PyTorch. First we reproduce this model, then we dissect it to understand how it works. This demo showcases building a generative adversarial network, or GAN, for performing style transfer. How were the layers at which the losses were attached chosen? This is unknown to me. As for the definitions of the losses themselves, the original document has good descriptions: LBFGS is the optimizer suggested by the original author of this implementation here.
