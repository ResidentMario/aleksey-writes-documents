This notebook demonstrates how a data scientist would approach exploring a dataset, building a model, and saving that model within a workflow utilizing Quilt T4. We will build a convolutional neural network based on the Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST is an image dataset curated by the folks at Zalando Research specifically for the purpose of providing a good default dataset for use in image classification tasks. It consists of a moderately large set of 28x28 images of various fashion items, which have been assigned to one of ten different classes. This dataset is useful for benchmarking image classification challenges, as it is significantly harder than the extremely well-known MNIST dataset, whilst still being easy enough that relatively straightforward image classification techniques may be used to solve it; and it is very well-curated. We'll cover the full workflow typical for a data scientist: exploration, model training, model evaluation, and then saving that model. We'll see how T4 can help with saving the dataset and saving the model remotely. To learn more, read the complimentary blog post: [STILL FORTHCOMING].
