In this notebook I've parsed out the set of origin/destination pairs in the dataset and plotted them. Most of the parsing code is lifted from this notebook. The end result, a geospatial Sankey plot, is generated using the geoplot library. You can see a similar example in the geoplot documentation: here. Note that flight paths are idealized shortest-distance paths (otherwise known as great circle paths). In reality the flights will follow paths specific to the wind conditions in their area.
