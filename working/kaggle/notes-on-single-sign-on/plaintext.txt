Single sign-on, or SSO, is the ability for a single set of credentials to serve equivalently across many different independent pieces of software. Single sign-on is an oft-cited requirement of enterprise software. Most of the benefits of SSO have to do with convenience, but the big security benefit is that it means that user auth (IDs and passwords) are stored internally within the org instead of externally with a third party. In practice, two-factor auth replaces the need for a centralized service. A centralized service constitutes a centralized point of failure; if the Kerberos server goes down, what do you do? However, many enterprise companies are stuck with SSO as a requirement because it was long ago enshrined into security best practices for working with sensitive data types, like financial or health records. LDAP and SAML are notoriously difficult to implement correctly (the former especially). There are now identity-directory-as-a-service APIs that let you set these things up without having to manage a cluster yourself. The winning market solution for this ask (more or less) is Microsoft Active Directory. For example AWS runs their own managed AD service as the AWS Directory Service. You can migrate your historical in-house-managed identity service to a managed identity service on the cloud. This has two net effects:
