This page is a collection of things I've learned which are helpful for debugging Docker and/or Kubernetes systems. The first is docker run -ti --entrypoint=/bin/bash ID, where ID is the SHA-256 identifier or the image tag. What this command does: --entrypoint=/bin/bash overrides the ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile with your own. Recall that the ENTRYPOINT is command-line argument you want to get executed at run time. Replacing the entrypoint with /bin/bash means that a bash process is opened as the last step of the shell.
