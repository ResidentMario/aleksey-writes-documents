    New Yorkers called (or tweeted, wrote to, or texted) 311, the city's non-emergency
    service hotline, over 2 million times in 2016. Thanks to NYC Open Data, the metadata of each and every single one
    of those calls is publicly available.
 
    I put together a visual explainer of what they wanted. Click on any of the cells below to drill deeper, or on

    We can see right away that 311 is dominated by calls falling in one of six categories:
 
    311 calls are organized according to a fairly well thought-out system, but like any real-world ontology it's one
    with a lot of quirks and operational carve-outs. For that reason it's a bit difficult to read more deeply in the
    data: we learn that there are 200 complaints a year specifically about sanitation truck noise, for example, but
    the data says nothing about complaints about train service, say, or about police reports.
 
    Indeed, a friend of mine who worked as a 311 operator remarked once that not the most common calls, but certainly
    the longest-lasting, were simply old folks needing someone to talk to. Where do you classify that? It's not as
    easy as you might think, and even what you see here required a lot of clean up by your author. Nevertheless, we
    can still make some interesting smaller observations:
