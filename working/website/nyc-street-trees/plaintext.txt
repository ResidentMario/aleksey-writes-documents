    I had a great time at today's Tree Count Data
    Jam, a National Day of Civic Hacking hackathon put on by BetaNYC, the New York City Parks Department,
    Civic Hall, and a field of well-involved community sponsors (CartoDB, Microsoft, etc.).
 
    Following up on my success with spam.js from yesterday, my team put
    together another viz using the library, this time with a selector for painting a chloropleth by
    selection—using either population density or area—for understanding the distribution throughout the
    boroughs of the subject of the day's hacking, the results (still partial, mind) of the 2015 Street Tree Census.
 
    Despite the limited time we had to work on it, the result is nevertheless beautiful. Our team was me, Nayoung
    Ahn, Sri Nandula, and Alec Barrett—who handled all of the data munging
    operations in R.
