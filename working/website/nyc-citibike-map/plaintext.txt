    Back in March 2014 New York City's bikeshare system, Citi Bike, publicly released data
    on trips taken using their bikes. It didn't take long for mappers to get their hands on it; a really beautiful-looking geographic
    volume plot (geographic Sankey diagram?) came out just a couple of months later, depicting street routes taken
    by Citi Bikes in the city by volume. The map was made by Oliver O'Brien, a researcher at University College London.
 
    Unfortunately Citi Bike has been through a major expansion since then, and this data is now out of date.
 
    Here's an updated current version:
 
    Data is the same used for my Life
    of CitiBike project, technically two orders of magnitude fewer trips, but still more than good enough. The
    most important caveat is the same: this map uses idealized routes generated by the Google Maps API, which may
    differ from the actual, perhaps more circuitous routes bikers take.
 
    Try bringing up the old map and the new one and comparing the two.
    You may notice that there are some significant differences!
 
    Sadly this map, too, is already technically inaccurateâ€”another major CitiBike
    station expansion began this August.
